<h1>Ask a Question</h1>

<section>
  <p>If you have a programming-related question and want to ask it effectively,
    follow these steps:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Create a concise, one-line title that summarizes your problem.</li>
    <li>Describe your problem in detail. Be sure to provide enough information
      so that others can understand the issue and offer helpful solutions.</li>
    <li>Explain what you've already tried to solve the problem and what you
      expected to happen. This will give others an idea of where you are in the
      process and what steps they can suggest next.</li>
    <li>Add "tags" to your question, which are keywords or labels that help
      categorize it and make it easier for others to find.
    </li>
    <li>Review your question to ensure that it's clear and concise. Once you're
      satisfied, post it to the site and wait for responses from the community.
      Remember to engage with those who respond to your question, as this can
      help clarify any misunderstandings and lead to a better solution.
    </li>
  </ul>
